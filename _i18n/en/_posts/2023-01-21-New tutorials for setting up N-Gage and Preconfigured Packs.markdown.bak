The emulator has changed very much in the last 2 years since its boom over N-Gage popularity, with some more quality-of-life changes to make using EKA2L1 as a N-Gage emulator easier than before.

Many tutorials on Youtube are not as up-to-date as before since there's no incentive to renew it. And there are also many people that find difficulties in the aspect of installing N-Gage games into the emulator and don't want to join the Discord server.

Understanding the struggle, I have tried to make 2 specific **tutorials** to **set up the emulator for N-Gage emulation** purpose, for desktop and Android version of the emulator. In addition, there's one another tutorial for installing **BLZ games**, and one for **installing the preconfigured packs**.

Here is the [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFUlsSGkRjc&list=PLkrpMo4_xadtJ_Kqvc5BSTSi39ollsAbR)

I hope it is helpful and hearable.

Happy Lunar New Year!
新年快乐！
Chúc mừng năm mới!
